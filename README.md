## Standardized Architecture for PCI DSS on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up an AWS Cloud environment that provides a standardized architecture for Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) compliance. PCI DSS helps ensure that companies maintain a secure environment for storing, processing, and transmitting credit card information. The Quick Start relies on the requirements of PCI DSS version 3.2.1.

The templates in the Quick Start automatically configure the AWS resources and deploy a multi-tier, Linux-based web application in a few simple steps. The Quick Start includes a main template for initial setup and three optional templates for additional customization.
